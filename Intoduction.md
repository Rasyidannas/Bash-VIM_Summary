# What is Shell Scripting?

It involves using scripting languages, such as Bash, to write a series of commands and instructions that can be executed sequentially. Shell scripts are commonly used in Unix-like operating systems for system administration and automation purposes.

# Shortcut in Bash
## Aliases
An alias in Bash is a way to create a shortcut for a command or a series of commands. You can see default aliases by writing `alias`, for making new alias you can write `alias [name]='[command]'`, but this way only temporary alias. If you want to make a permanent alias you can edit with Vim by writing `vim ~/.bashrc`. `unalias [name]` is for deleting or removing an existing alias.
